Life‑Cycle Huggett Model with Age‑Specific Gini Analysis

This repository contains a quantitative overlapping‑generations (OLG) model in the tradition of Huggett (1993). The code solves a steady‑state general equilibrium in which households face idiosyncratic labour income risk, decide how much to save, and are subject to capital‐ and labour‑income taxes. It is designed to study how tax policy, demographics and retirement benefits interact to shape macroeconomic aggregates and inequality.

Overview

At the heart of the project is a solver that iterates on the aggregate capital stock and lump‑sum transfers until the household and firm sectors are consistent in general equilibrium. This routine prints macro aggregates (output, capital, consumption, wages and interest rates) and calculates wealth‑, earnings‑ and disposable‑income Gini coefficients, both overall and by age group
. The code accepts model parameters from input_params.txt and age‑specific efficiency and survival profiles from input_vectors.txt, so the demographic structure and policy parameters are easy to change.

The model can be run in two modes:

Baseline vs. Tax‑reform comparison – When run_opt = 1 in the parameter file, main.m solves the model under user‑specified tax rates and a benchmark scenario (e.g. τ_k=0.165, τ_l=0.03). It overlays life‑cycle profiles of consumption, capital, savings and income for the two scenarios and compares key aggregates and inequality statistics

.

Calibration via SMM – When run_opt = 2, the model is calibrated using a simulated method of moments (SMM) to match empirical moments of the capital–output ratio and the earnings Gini coefficient. The routine calibrate_model.m minimises a weighted sum of squared moment errors, adjusting the discount factor (β) and risk‑aversion parameter (σ)
. The calibrated parameters and model moments are printed and saved for later use.

Key Components
File	Description
main.m	Top‑level script that reads parameters, chooses a run mode and calls the solver or calibration routine. It also produces side‑by‑side plots comparing baseline and reform scenarios
newtab
.
solve_model.m	Core steady‑state solver. Iterates on capital and transfers, solves households’ value functions, simulates the distribution, and computes macro aggregates and inequality statistics
.
calibrate_model.m	Implements simulated method of moments. Targets the capital‑to‑output ratio and earnings Gini, and uses lsqnonlin to estimate β and σ
.
calc_dist_stats.m	Computes wealth, earnings and disposable‑income distributions; returns Gini coefficients, top shares and bottom shares, both overall and by age group.
plot_* scripts	Produce figures of distributions, value/policy functions, life‑cycle profiles and Gini curves for both single and comparative scenarios.
input_params.txt	Plain‑text file containing all model and policy parameters (grid sizes, tax rates, production parameters, demographics, etc.).
input_vectors.txt	Contains the deterministic efficiency profile (ȳ_i) and survival probabilities (s_{i+1}) for each age.
Usage

Setup – This project uses MATLAB. Clone or download the repository, then open the folder final_updated_code_with_age_gini_total/final_updated_code_with_age_gini_updated in MATLAB. Ensure that the working directory contains all *.m scripts and the input_*.txt files.

Choose a run mode – In input_params.txt set run_opt=1 to solve and compare the baseline and reform scenarios, or run_opt=2 to perform the SMM calibration. Adjust tauk and taul in the same file to specify tax rates. The other parameters (e.g. grid sizes, discount factor, depreciation, number of ages) can also be modified here.

Run the model – From the MATLAB command window, execute

main


This will solve the model, print the macroeconomic summary (including capital, output, consumption and Gini statistics) and generate figures. If calibration is selected, the estimated parameters and moment matching results will be printed. Figures are saved automatically to the working directory.

Calibration – To recalibrate the model separately, run run_calibration.m. This script calls calibrate_model.m, performs the SMM estimation and saves smm_solution.mat for later use.

Interpreting Results

After running the model, the console will show the final steady‑state values of capital, output, consumption and tax revenues alongside the Gini coefficients for wealth, earnings and disposable income. For example, the solver prints “Wealth Gini” and “Earnings Gini” lines in the summary, reflecting the inequality outcomes
. When comparing scenarios, additional summary statistics display the differences in aggregates and Gini coefficients
newtab
. Figures generated by the plot_* scripts illustrate how consumption, capital, savings and income evolve over the life cycle under different tax regimes and how the distributional statistics vary by age.

Extensibility

The modular design means the model can be adapted for other policy experiments. Changing the demographic profile, introducing social‑security benefits, or modifying the income process can all be accomplished by editing input_params.txt, input_vectors.txt or the relevant functions. The SMM framework can target additional moments simply by expanding the moments_data vector in calibrate_model.m and supplying new empirical moments.
